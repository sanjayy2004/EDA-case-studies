# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Case Studies

This repository contains a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case studies
performed on real-world datasets as part of my data science and machine learning
learning journey.

The goal of these case studies is to understand data behavior, identify patterns,
handle missing values and outliers, and extract meaningful insights before model building.
