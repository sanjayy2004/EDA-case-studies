# US Honey Production – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
Analyze the US Honey Production dataset to understand production trends over time, state-wise contributions, and the factors influencing honey yield and total production in the United States.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** US Honey Production Dataset  
- **Number of Rows:** ~600  
- **Number of Features:** 8  
- **Target Variable:** `totalprod` (Total Honey Production)

---

## 🧾 Key Features
- `state` – US state  
- `year` – Year of observation  
- `numcol` – Number of colonies  
- `yieldpercol` – Yield per colony  
- `totalprod` – Total honey production  
- `stocks` – Honey stocks  
- `priceperlb` – Price per pound  
- `prodvalue` – Total production value  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze honey production trends over the years  
- Understand state-wise honey production patterns  
- Study the relationship between colonies, yield, and production  
- Identify factors affecting honey production value  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand structure and data quality  
2. Checked for missing values and ensured correct data types  
3. Performed:
   - Univariate exploratory analysis  
   - Multivariate exploratory analysis  
4. Analyzed:
   - Year-wise production trends  
   - State-wise production contributions  
5. Visualized relationships between:
   - Number of colonies  
   - Yield per colony  
   - Total production  
   - Honey prices  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Honey production has shown a **declining trend** over the years  
- Certain states consistently contribute a **major share** of total production  
- A decline in the **number of colonies** directly impacts total production  
- **Yield per colony** plays a critical role in overall honey output  
- Honey prices have **increased despite declining production**, indicating demand pressure  

---

## 📈 Results / Findings
- **State**, **year**, **number of colonies**, and **yield per colony** are strong indicators of total honey production  
- The analysis highlights **structural changes** in honey production across the US over time  
- Rising prices suggest increasing demand or supply constraints in the honey industry  

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed significant long-term trends in US honey production, including declining output and increasing prices.  
These insights can help:
- Policymakers understand agricultural challenges  
- Analysts assess industry sustainability  
- Businesses make informed pricing and sourcing decisions  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build predictive models for honey production and pricing  
- Perform time-series forecasting  
- Analyze environmental or policy-related factors affecting colony decline
